## Why RedStone?

The current model of oracle systems suffers from significant inefficiencies, which RedStone Oracles was specifically designed to solve from the ground up.

### Problem #1: Inefficient and Expensive Data Provision
The standard approach of providing data to applications involves ‘pushing’ the data onto the blockchain regardless of whether it is used by an application. This results in unnecessary costs and resource allocation.

**Our Solution:**  
RedStone offers an on-demand data provision model instead of a fixed schedule. This approach reduces the costs associated with putting data 'on-chain'. By storing data off-chain as cryptographically signed packages, RedStone allows smart contracts of dApps to fetch data only when necessary.RedStone’s innovative approach significantly enhances efficiency for dApps and reduces the costs to access data feeds.

### Problem #2: Limited Scalability Due to Monolithic Architecture 
Monolithic architectures in traditional oracles make it difficult for protocols to reduce latency and add new assets quickly.

**Our Solution:**  
RedStone is built with a modular architecture, making it easy to incorporate new assets and reduce latency. This modular design ensures that components like data sources, validation mechanisms, and delivery methods can be interchanged, updated, or augmented without disrupting overall functionality. This modularity enables dApps to scale more efficiently, adapting to changing needs and integrating new features seamlessly.
