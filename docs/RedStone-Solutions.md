# Why RedStone?

The current model of oracle systems suffers from significant inefficiencies, which RedStone Oracles was specifically designed to solve from the ground up.

# The Problems RedStone Solves ♦️

### Problem #1: Inefficient and Expensive Data Provision

**The Issue:**  
The standard approach of providing data to applications involves ‘pushing’ the data onto the blockchain regardless of whether it is used by an application. This results in unnecessary costs and resource allocation.

**Our Solution:**  
RedStone offers an on-demand data provision model instead of a fixed schedule. This approach reduces the costs associated with putting data 'on-chain'. By storing data off-chain as cryptographically signed packages, RedStone allows smart contracts of dApps to fetch data only when necessary.

**Data Integrity:**  
To ensure data integrity, RedStone also provides data feeds to Arweave, a decentralized network known for its tamper-proof storage. Data provided by RedStone to Arweave acts as an unbiased, immutable source of truth about historical data.

**Outcome:**  
RedStone’s innovative approach significantly enhances efficiency for dApps and reduces the costs associated with accessing data feeds.

### Problem #2: Limited Scalability Due to Monolithic Architecture

**The Issue:**  
Monolithic architectures in traditional oracles make it difficult for protocols to reduce latency and add new assets quickly.

**Our Solution:**  
RedStone is built with a modular architecture, making it easy to incorporate new assets and reduce latency. This modular design ensures that components like data sources, validation mechanisms, and delivery methods can be interchanged, updated, or augmented without disrupting overall functionality.

**Outcome:**  
This modularity enables dApps to scale more efficiently, adapting to changing needs and integrating new features seamlessly.
